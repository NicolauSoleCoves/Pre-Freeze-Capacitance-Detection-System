# Pre-Freeze Capacitance Detection System â€“ Final Documentation

This repository contains all the necessary documentation to understand, reproduce, and build the final version of the **Pre-Freeze Capacitance Detection System**.  
It includes schematics, design files, experiment data, and explanations covering both the hardware and software involved in the system.

## Overview

The system was designed to detect early changes in capacitance related to the onset of freezing in water-based samples. This documentation provides:

- Hardware setup and wiring diagrams
- PCB and enclosure designs
- Firmware and data acquisition scripts
- Experimental results and analysis
