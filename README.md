# 🧊 Detection System for Preventing Tissue Damage in Cryotherapy  
### 📍 Bachelor’s Thesis – UPC-EEBE (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya – Escola d’Enginyeria de Barcelona Est)

This repository contains the experimental datasets, signal analysis scripts, and result visualizations developed for the Bachelor's Thesis **"Detection System for Preventing Tissue Damage in Cryotherapy through Temperature and Capacitance Monitoring"**.

The system was designed and validated to detect the onset of freezing in biological tissues during cryotherapy, using a combination of temperature and capacitive sensing.

## 📖 Abstract

Cryotherapy is a widely used technique for treating localized tissue damage and tumors through controlled freezing. However, uncontrolled overcooling can result in irreversible tissue damage.  
This thesis proposes a detection system that monitors both **temperature** and **capacitance** in real-time to identify the **onset of freezing** and anticipate the **exothermic peak** characteristic of phase change.

The detection algorithm is based on two main approaches:
- **Gradient-based analysis** of the capacitance signal
- **Standard deviation thresholding** to detect signal stabilization

The system was validated through a series of controlled freezing experiments on fluid-mimicking samples using a thermistor and a parallel-plate capacitive sensor.
